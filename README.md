# Todo Application

This is a simple Todo application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It includes user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their personal todo lists.

## Features

- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Create, read, update, and delete todos
- Each user can manage their own todo list

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (using Mongoose)
- JWT for authentication
- Postman for API testing

Note
This project currently has the SECRET_KEY and PORT hardcoded for simplicity. It's recommended to use environment variables for sensitive information in a production environment.
